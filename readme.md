# 🏎️ Formula 1 Data Analysis Project

This is a personal side project focused on exploring and analyzing Formula 1 race data.
The project is built as a learning and experimentation project, combining an interest in
Formula 1 with data engineering, data analysis and basic machine learning.

The goal is to work with **publicly available F1 data** and gradually build:
- a structured data pipeline
- exploratory analysis of race and qualifying results
- simple predictive models for race outcomes
- a small frontend for visualization

---

### backend/
Contains Python code for:
- fetching data from public F1 APIs (e.g. Ergast)
- transforming and cleaning race data
- feature engineering and simple ML models

### data/
Stores:
- raw API responses
- processed datasets
- local databases (e.g. DuckDB)

### frontend/
Planned frontend for:
- visualizing race results and trends
- displaying predictions and summaries

---

## 📊 Data Sources (Planned)
- Ergast Developer API (race results, qualifying, drivers, constructors)
- Public historical Formula 1 datasets

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)
- Python
- Pandas
- DuckDB
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Streamlit (frontend)
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Practice structuring a data project end-to-end
- Analyze Formula 1 performance trends
- Explore the impact of qualifying on race results
- Experiment with basic predictive models
- Build a clean and understandable codebase suitable for a portfolio project

## 🚧 Project Status
This project is under active development and will evolve iteratively as new features,
analyses and models are added.
